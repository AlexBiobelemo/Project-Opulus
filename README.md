# Project-Opulus

## Overview
Project-Opulus is a **prototype** social media algorithm simulator application developed using Replit in just **10 minutes**. It is designed to visualize and experiment with how different algorithm parameters impact content distribution and user engagement in a simulated environment. The system uses AI-powered bots that autonomously create posts and interact with content, enabling a dynamic and real-time analytics-driven study of social media algorithms.

This project offers a unique platform to understand and analyze the behavior of social media content flow and engagement through a highly customizable and interactive simulation.

## Features
- **AI-powered bots**: Autonomous agents simulate user behavior by creating posts, commenting, reposting, and engaging with other content.
- **Algorithm manipulation**: Users can tweak algorithm parameters to observe their effects on content distribution and engagement patterns.
- **Real-time analytics**: Live tracking of engagement metrics and content reach during the simulation.
- **Visualization tools**: Interactive visuals to display how changes in algorithm parameters affect the system.
- **User interface**: Intuitive UI components allow easy control over simulation settings and parameter adjustments.
- **Data logging**: Simulation runs are logged for further analysis and performance review.
- **Built with TypeScript and CSS**: Modern web technologies power the frontend and backend logic for real-time responsiveness and style.

## Known Limitations
- Some features, such as **content details viewing** and **bot editing**, are currently **not working** and remain under development.
- As a rapid prototype, the system prioritizes core simulation functionality over completeness and stability.

## Use Cases
- **Social media platform research**: Helps researchers and developers understand the impact of different algorithmic rules on content visibility and user engagement.
- **Algorithm design and testing**: Provides a sandbox environment for testing new social media algorithms before deploying them in real-world applications.
- **Marketing strategy optimization**: Enables marketing teams to simulate how content might perform under different algorithmic conditions to optimize campaign strategies.
- **Educational tool**: Serves as a learning resource for students and professionals studying social media dynamics and AI-driven recommendation systems.
- **User behavior analysis**: Allows examination of how AI-driven bots and user interactions affect overall platform engagement metrics.
- **Content moderation simulations**: Can be extended to test how algorithm changes might influence content quality, misinformation spread, or user safety metrics.

## Installation
To set up Project-Opulus locally, clone the repository and run:
```bash
npm install
